# Alaskan Census Areas' Physcal Inactivity and Exercise Opportunites
#### This repository was created for Professor Gotzler's English 105 class in the Spring of 2024, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
- Contains: raw data set and subset that was manipulated via Pyhton. 

- As well as, [Python Notebook](https://github.com/awin117/Alaskan-Census-Areas-Phsyical-Inactivity-and-Excersie-Opportunity/blob/main/Unit_3_Final_Project!.ipynb) included the process for crafting subset from the orginal raw data.

### What does the dataset provide?
The repository provides a comprehensive dataset containing valuable information about physical inactivity rates and access to exercise opportunities in Alaska's census areas over the course of 2014 to 2015. 


### What could this data be used for?
- This repository is useful for researchers, policymakers, health professionals, and anyone interested in public health and fitness initiatives.
- Users can formulate evidence-based strategies to address physical inactivity issues, allocate resources effectively to improve access to exercise opportunities, and promote healthier lifestyles within Alaska communities.

### How can users get started with the repository?
- Users can start by downloading the [dataset](https://github.com/awin117/Alaskan-Census-Areas-Phsyical-Inactivity-and-Excersie-Opportunity/blob/main/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv) from the repository and exploring the provided data fields. 
- They can utilize various data analysis tools and techniques to visualize trends, perform statistical analysis, and extract meaningful insights from the dataset. 
- Additionally, users can refer to any accompanying documentation or code examples to aid in their analysis.

### Data Visualization
Visulaizations were created using Datawrapper and the [subset](https://github.com/awin117/Alaskan-Census-Areas-Phsyical-Inactivity-and-Excersie-Opportunity/blob/main/chart_data.csv) created in accordance to the Python notebook.
Aggergations to the subset was made in Excel to ensure calarity in graphs, Excel workbook is also attached.
  - No changes to data were made, just aggergated to create clear 2014 and 2015 data that are not interweaved.
  - Two seperate pages within the same Excel workbook were made, contain orginal subset, 2014 data, and 2015 data
  - Visualizations of your own can be made [here](https://www.datawrapper.de/) for the created subset.

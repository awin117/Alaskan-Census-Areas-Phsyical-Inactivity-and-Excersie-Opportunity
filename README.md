# Alaskan Census Areas' Physcal Inactivity and Exercise Opportunites
#### This repository was created for Professor Gotzler's English 105 class in the Spring of 2024, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
- Contains: raw data set and subset that was manipulated via Pyhton. 

- As well as, Python notebook included processies for crafting subset from the orginal raw data.

### What does the dataset provide?
The repository provides a comprehensive dataset containing valuable information about physical inactivity rates and access to exercise opportunities in Alaska's census areas over the course of 2014 to 2015. 


### What could this data be used for?
- This repository is useful for researchers, policymakers, health professionals, and anyone interested in public health and fitness initiatives.
- Users can formulate evidence-based strategies to address physical inactivity issues, allocate resources effectively to improve access to exercise opportunities, and promote healthier lifestyles within Alaska communities.

### How can users get started with the repository?
- Users can start by downloading the dataset from the repository and exploring the provided data fields. 
- They can utilize various data analysis tools and techniques to visualize trends, perform statistical analysis, and extract meaningful insights from the dataset. 
- Additionally, users can refer to any accompanying documentation or code examples to aid in their analysis.

### Data Visualization
Visulaizations were created using Datawrapper and the subsets created in accordance to the Python notebook.
Aggergations to the subset was made in Excel to ensure calarity in graphs, Excel workbook is also attached.
  - No changes to data were made, just aggergated to create clear 2014 and 2015 data that are not interweaved.
  - Two seperate pages within the same Excel workbook were made, contain orginal subset, 2014 data, and 2015 data
  - Visualizations of your own can be made [here](https://www.datawrapper.de/) for the created subset.
